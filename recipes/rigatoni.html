        Rigatoni is a type of Italian pasta known for its large, tube-like shape and characteristic ridges along its surface. The name "rigatoni" derives from the Italian word <em>rigato</em>, meaning "ridged," which describes the pasta's defining texture. This pasta typically has a slightly curved but firm shape that holds up well in both baked and stovetop dishes, making it a popular choice for hearty recipes. Rigatoni’s size and shape make it ideal for capturing thick sauces, as the ridges and hollow center trap and hold onto sauces like Bolognese, marinara, and creamy Alfredo, ensuring every bite is packed with flavor.

This pasta is also a popular choice for one-pot meals, casseroles, and meat-based sauces that benefit from a substantial pasta shape. Its heartiness and ability to capture sauce make rigatoni a comforting, filling choice for those seeking a pasta that complements rich and savory ingredients, making it a favorite in kitchens worldwide.
