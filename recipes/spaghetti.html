        Spaghetti is a traditional Italian pasta characterized by its long, thin, cylindrical shape that resembles strands of string. Made from durum wheat semolina and water, spaghetti is both hearty and versatile, making it a staple in Italian cuisine and beloved around the world. Its firm, chewy texture, especially when cooked <em>al dente</em>, pairs well with various sauces and ingredients, from simple olive oil and garlic to rich, savory Bolognese and marinara sauces. Spaghetti is often topped with Parmesan or fresh herbs, adding depth to its flavor and bringing a delightful contrast to the smooth, saucy coating on each strand.
